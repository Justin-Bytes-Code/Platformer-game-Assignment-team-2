# Platformer Game
**Intro**

This is a medium level 2D - 3D Platformer Prototype of a Unreal Engine v4 Game, done in only 4 weeks using ONLY unreals blueprints. The challange consist of selecting a genere that had requirements then working with a team of classmates to create a game. This was done a year or two back so I have grown a lot since then. I wanted to publish it now open source to let other view into our work of what we have created in this simple demo.

**How To Play**

The goal of the game is written on a sign right next to the start location. Your goal is to reach the top and collect keys to win but to do this you will need to collect power ups and dodge obstacles. You have 3 lives and if you lose all of them you will go back to the start! Though out the adventure you will need to focus on health and good platforming!

**How It Can Be Exapanded**

The game could be expanded multiple different ways a good place to start is the things I haven't implemented due to time constaints. 

- A way for the player to kill enemies. We really wanted to add this but due to time constraints and me moving houses that semester we coudln't.
- Rework lighting. While the lighting is fine for what we did now that is because I personally after the game was finished went though and fixed a lot of it. It was still very rough. 
- Clear directions. The level design is good however due to how close everything is it could lead to players getting lost. To avoid this fixing the position of enemies/people will be the best course of action!

**Frequently Asked Questions**

Q: "Why did I get teleported back to the start?"

A: When you run out of lives you will get teleported back to the start. 

Q: "Why Post this open source?" 

A: I believe a good programmer should have code anyone can understand if they look at the source. With this project I wanted other to look at the code I created as it is neat and completely commented for easy documentation. Feel free to look and take any blueprints you like even the model! If any teammates find this and would like it removed contact me! I can do that!

Q: "I don't know where to go?" 

A: I have left documents inside of my github repo if you'd like to view them describing the full level. But the basic path is From the starting position (All the way right. Grab Power up. Head left to floating platform grab health power up. Go back to spawn then make your way up to the top of the stone arch. Climb down then get back onto the floating platform where HP was. Get higher. Then make a jump toward the door. During this you should be collecting keys!) {If still confused check out the documents on github} 

Q: "Where are the golems?"

A: The golems were functional and DID work. However due to the project miniumum size requirement they had to be cut. This was sad news however this is still videos on the github showing the golems. (We used bit bucket which barely let us fit the game even)
